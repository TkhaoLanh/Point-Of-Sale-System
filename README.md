## Point Of Sale System
Today, the `point-of-sale system` plays a `crucial role` in many `industrial markets`, including the `restaurant` and `supply chain`. 

Regarding the same, we have thought about `developing` our own system specifically for `coffee shops` as part of the `Java 2 project`. There are some `functionalities` that will be built into this system, such as:

>1. Giving assistance to the `cashier` to `place an order` following the `customer's request`
>2. Providing the `drink details`
>3. Printing the `bill`.
