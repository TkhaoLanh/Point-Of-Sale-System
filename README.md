## Getting Started

Today, the point-of-sale system plays a crucial role in many industrial markets, including the restaurant and supply chain. Regarding the same, we have thought about developing our own system specifically for coffee shops as part of the Java 2 project. There are some functionalities that will be built into this system, such as giving assistance to the cashier to place an order following the customer's request, providing the drink details, and printing the bill. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
