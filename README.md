## Point Of Sale System
Today, the point-of-sale system plays a crucial role in many industrial markets, including the restaurant and supply chain. Regarding the same, we have thought about developing our own system specifically for coffee shops as part of the Java 2 project. There are some functionalities that will be built into this system, such as giving assistance to the cashier to place an order following the customer's request, providing the drink details, and printing the bill.
